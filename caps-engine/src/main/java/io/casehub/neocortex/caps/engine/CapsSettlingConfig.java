/**
 * Configuration for CAPS network settling — attractor extraction and
 * distortion thresholds during iterative activation propagation.
 * <p>
 * The settling process propagates activations through the CAPS network
 * until convergence or oscillation, then extracts behavioral attractors
 * from output nodes. These parameters control noise filtering and
 * saturation detection during that process.
 * <p>
 * Iteration count, convergence epsilon, and weight caps are configured
 * per-topology via {@code WeightUpdateParameters}. This config covers
 * the remaining global thresholds not tied to a specific topology.
 * <p>
 * Parameter interactions: minEffectiveDistortionThreshold controls which
 * distortions fire during settling — it operates independently of the
 * output-stage parameters. attractorStrengthMinFilter and
 * saturationActivationThreshold both affect what the settling result
 * reports: the former filters individual attractors, the latter
 * determines the saturation ratio which modulates attractor metadata
 * (highSat flag). saturationActivationThreshold works in tandem with
 * saturationWarningThreshold in WeightUpdateParameters — one defines
 * what counts as saturated, the other defines when to warn about it.
