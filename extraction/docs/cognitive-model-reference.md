# Neocortex Cognitive Model — Complete Reference

This document is the authoritative reference for every concept, value type, and psychological foundation in the casehub-neocortex cognitive system. It covers all subsystems from affect and emotion through personality, memory, reasoning, and consolidation.

---

## 1. Memory System

The memory system stores all cognitive content across six typed domains. Every memory belongs to a `Subject` (typed entity reference: `type` + `id`, lowercase-normalised type) and a `MemoryDomain` (string-named domain).

### 1.1 Memory Domains

| Domain | What it stores | Psychological basis |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| `experience` | Observations, actions, outcomes — what happened | Episodic memory (Tulving) |
| `relationship` | Per-agent-pair interaction records with quality signals | Social cognition, attachment theory |
| `reflection` | Synthesised insights at hierarchical levels | Metacognition (Flavell) |
| `mood` | PAD emotional state snapshots over time | Mehrabian's PAD model |

## 2. Experience Events

Typed agent experience ingestion — the primary way cognitive agents record what happens.

**Sealed hierarchy:** `ExperienceEvent` permits `Observation`, `Action`, `Outcome`, `FormativeExperience`

| Type | Extra fields | What it represents |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| `Observation` | `subject` (required) | Something the agent noticed about an entity |
| `Action` | `capability` | Something the agent did |
| `Outcome` | `result` (required), `capability` | The result of an action |
| `FormativeExperience` | `catalogueEntryId`, `situationTypes`, `salienceMultiplier`, `reinforcementSchedule`, `developmentalPeriod`, PAD | Biographical/developmental experience (backstory seeding) |

All share: `agentId`, `tenantId`, `caseId`, `turnId`, `timestamp`, `description`, `confidence`, `metadata`

### 2.1 Sub-Thought Types

Experience memories can be decomposed into typed sub-thoughts — sentence-level cognitive fragments.

**Constants:** `SubThoughtTypes`

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `affect-observation` | Emotional reaction noted in the experience |
| `causal-inference` | Agent's reasoning about cause and effect |
| `evaluative` | Value judgment or assessment |

| `association` | Connection drawn to other knowledge |
| `concern` | Worry or anxiety about a situation |

**Psychological basis:** Dual-process theory (Kahneman) — sub-thoughts capture the automatic System 1 reactions that accompany deliberate experience processing.

---

## 3. Affect — The PAD Model

Emotional state is represented as a point in the three-dimensional PAD space.

**Psychological basis:** Mehrabian's PAD (Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance) model of emotional state

### 3.1 Dimensions

| Dimension | Range | Low end | High end | What it measures |
|-----------|-------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **Pleasure** (P) | [-1, +1] | Pain, distress, unhappiness | Joy, ecstasy, satisfaction | Hedonic valence — how good/bad the agent feels |
| **Arousal** (A) | [-1, +1] | Calm, relaxed, sleepy | Excited, stimulated, alert | Activation level — how energised the agent is |
| **Dominance** (D) | [-1, +1] | Submissive, controlled, helpless | Dominant, in-control, influential | Sense of control — how much agency the agent feels |

### 3.2 Mood Types

| Type | Fields | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `MoodState` | `agentId`, `tenantId`, `timestamp`, `pleasure`, `arousal`, `dominance`, `cause`, `turnId`, `activeContextIds`, `metadata` | Current emotional state snapshot |
| `MoodBaseline` | `pleasure`, `arousal`, `dominance` | Per-agent resting emotional state — the PAD values mood decays toward |
| `MoodDecay` | Static utility | Exponential decay: `current + (baseline - current) * (1 - e^(-elapsed/tau))` |

### 3.3 PAD on Nodes

MindMap nodes carry PAD dimensions directly (`pleasure`, `arousal`, `dominance` — all `Double`). This represents the affective valence associated with an entity — how the agent feels about that person, place, concept, or goal.

**Connection to mood:** The `AffectTrajectoryDecorator` intercepts node PAD updates and stores domain="affect" memories, enabling longitudinal affect analysis via `AffectTrajectoryAnalyzer` (slope, volatility, trend).

---

## 4. OCC Emotions

The system models 22 discrete emotion types from the OCC (Ortony, Clore & Collins) theory.

**Psychological basis:** OCC emotion model — emotions arise from appraising events, actions, and objects relative to goals, standards, and attitudes.

### 4.1 All 22 Emotion Types

**Enum:** `EmotionType`

| Branch | Emotions | Trigger |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Prospect-based** (goal lifecycle) | `HOPE`, `FEAR`, `SATISFACTION`, `DISAPPOINTMENT`, `RELIEF`, `FEARS_CONFIRMED` | Appraising future/past goal-relevant events |
| **Well-being** | `JOY`, `DISTRESS` | Appraising events as desirable/undesirable |
| **Fortunes of others** | `HAPPY_FOR`, `PITY` | Appraising events affecting liked others |
| **Fortunes of others** (disliked) | `RESENTMENT`, `GLOATING` | Appraising events affecting disliked others |
| **Attribution** | `PRIDE`, `SHAME`, `REPROACH`, `ADMIRATION` | Appraising self/other actions against standards |

## 5. CARMA Appraisal — The SEC Pipeline

The appraisal system evaluates incoming stimuli through Scherer's 4-stage Stimulus Evaluation Check pipeline. This is how raw perception becomes emotion.

**Psychological basis:** Scherer's Component Process Model (CPM) of emotion

### 5.1 The Four Stages

```
Stimulus → Relevance → Implications → Coping → Normative → Emotion
```

| Stage | SEC Dimensions evaluated | What it answers |
|-------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **Relevance** | `relevance`, `novelty`, `urgency` | Is this worth attending to? |
| **Implications** | `conduciveness` | Does this help or hinder my goals? |
| **Coping** | `controllability`, `adjustability` | Can I do anything about it? |
| **Normative** | `internal-standards`, `external-standards` | Does this conform to my values and social norms? |

### 5.2 SEC Dimensions

**Constants:** `SecDimensions`

| Dimension | Range | Meaning |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `relevance` | [0, 1] | How relevant to the agent's concerns |
| `novelty` | [0, 1] | How unexpected or new |
| `urgency` | [0, 1] | How time-pressured |
| `conduciveness` | [-1, 1] | Goal-positive (+) or goal-negative (-) |
| `controllability` | [0, 1] | How much the agent can influence the outcome |
| `adjustability` | [0, 1] | How well the agent can adapt |
| `internal-standards` | [0, 1] | Conformance to personal values (low = violation) |
| `external-standards` | [0, 1] | Conformance to social norms (low = violation) |

### 5.3 Appraisal Implementation

| `LlmAppraisalStrategy` | Single sub-LLM Haiku call — SEC dimensions + evocative narrative in one pass |
| `SchererAppraisalStrategy` | Composes keyword-based `SecCheck` implementations (fallback when no LLM) |
| `SalienceStrategy` | `@FunctionalInterface` — perception filtering gate before appraisal |

### 5.4 SEC → Emotion Mapping

`EmotionMapper.mapEmotions()` translates SEC dimension patterns to OCC emotions:

| Pattern | Emotion |
|---------|---------|
| High relevance + low conduciveness + low controllability | `FEAR` |
| High relevance + low conduciveness + high controllability | `ANGER` |
| High relevance + low conduciveness (moderate control) | `DISTRESS` |
| High relevance + high conduciveness | `JOY` |
| High relevance + low internal standards | `SHAME` |
| High relevance + low external standards | `REPROACH` |

---

## 6. Action Tendencies

Emotions produce behavioural impulses — action tendencies in the Frijda framework.

**Psychological basis:** Frijda's action tendency theory — emotions are not just felt states, they prepare the organism for action.

### 6.1 The 9 Action Readiness States

| `DriveIntensity` | Record: `axis`, `intensity` [0, 1], `trigger` (what caused it) |
| `DriveProfile` | Snapshot of all four drive intensities |
| `DriveCategory` | `BASELINE` (temperamental) or `CHARACTER` (personality-shaped) |
| `Drive` | Record: `name`, `category`, `intensity` [0, 1], `trigger` |

### 7.3 Drive Sources (implementations)

## 8. CAPS Personality System

The Cognitive-Affective Processing System models personality as a dynamic network of processing units.

**Psychological basis:** Mischel & Shoda's CAPS theory — personality is not a set of traits but a network of interconnected cognitive-affective units that produce consistent but situation-contingent behaviour.

### 8.1 Network Architecture

The CAPS topology contains approximately 74 nodes across three layers:

| Layer | Node Count | Role | Examples |
|-------|-----------|------|----------|
| **Input** (~30) | Situational encodings | Represent perceived situations | `trust_offered`, `criticism_received`, `rejection`, `achievement_opportunity`, `social_threat`, `novelty_encountered` |

| `precision` | Certainty of the weight (higher = resists learning updates 10x) |
| `effectiveWeight()` | `excitatory - inhibitory` |

**Weight Provenance** (`WeightProvenance`):

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `EMPIRICAL` | Derived from psychological research data |
| `CONSENSUS` | Agreed by domain experts |
| `ESTIMATED` | Computationally estimated |

### 8.4 Settling

When input nodes are clamped (e.g., `trust_offered = 0.8`), activation propagates through the network until it converges or oscillates.

**Type:** `SettlingResult`

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|

**Type:** `BehavioralAttractor`

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `category` | Behavioural category (social, approach, avoidance, etc.) |
| `nodeId` | Output node ID |
| `strength` | Pattern strength [0, 1] |
| `highSaturation` | Whether the node was at extreme activation |

| `baseThreshold` | Activation level that triggers the distortion |
| `multiplierMin/Max` | Range of the distortion amplification [compound cap: 0.1, 3.0] |
| `effect` | `MULTIPLICATIVE` or `ADDITIVE` |
| `negativeWeight/positiveWeight` | Asymmetric distortion (e.g., catastrophizing amplifies negatives) |
| `targetCategories` | Which node categories are affected |

### 8.6 Situation Classification

**SPI:** `SituationClassifier` — maps experience descriptions to CAPS input node activations

| Implementation | How it works |
|---------------|-------------|
| `RuleBasedSituationClassifier` | Keyword matching against topology input node keywords. Multi-label, 0.3 confidence threshold, multi-word phrase support |
| `LlmSituationClassifier` | LLM-backed classification via AgentProvider. Topology-aware system prompt with node IDs and keywords |

### 8.7 Disposition Modulation

`DispositionWeightMapper` adjusts CAPS connection weights based on the agent's disposition axes (socialOrient, ruleFollowing, riskAppetite, autonomy, conflictMode). Four resolution types: direct connection, tag group, node threshold, bare node name.

---

## 9. Goal System

Goals are represented as typed MindMap nodes in the GOAL subgraph with lifecycle management, affect, prioritisation, and decomposition.

### 9.1 Goal Vocabulary

Pre-registered edge types for goal relationships:

| Blocked + urgent | Frustration (negative P, high A) |
| Completed | Satisfaction (positive P) |
| Dormant | Reduced arousal |

### 9.3 Goal Urgency (GoalUrgency)

```

| Horizon | Budget |
|---------|--------|
| immediate | 4 hours |
| short | 1 day |
| medium | 7 days |
| long | 30 days |
| aspirational | 365 days |

Falls back to static `urgency` property when no target-date.

### 9.4 Goal Priority (GoalPrioritizationPhase)

Composite priority = `w_u*urgency + w_f*feasibility + w_a*affective_valence + w_i*importance`

### 9.5 Goal Lifecycle Signals
